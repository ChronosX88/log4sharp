# Log4Sharp

Dead-simple colorful logger for C#/.NET Core.

I have not found any simple loggers in the .NET Core ecosystem that are not framework-specific and have easy usage, so I decided to write this logger.

## Install

```
dotnet add package Log4Sharp
```

## Usage

```c#
using Log4Sharp;
...
Log.Info("Hello World!");
```
